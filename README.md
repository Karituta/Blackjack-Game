## Actions

Hit: The player wants to draw another card

Stand: The player does not want to draw another card

Double Down: The player doubles the initial bet and draws only one card. (Can only be done on initial dealing and with hands valuing 9,10, or 11)

Insurance: If the dealer's first card is an ace, the player can place an insurance bet. The insurance bet allows the player to break even if the dealer has a blackjack but otherwise will lose the insurance bet.

Split: The player splits the hand and creates two separate hands. (Can only be done if the cards are a pair)
